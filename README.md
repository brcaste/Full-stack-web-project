## Scenario 
<p>You are working for a company that licenses and customizes a software application to keep track of inventory in stores. Your job as a software developer is to customize this application to meet a specific customerâ€™s needs. You will choose any type of customer you would like, but it must sell a product composed of parts. An example of products versus parts would be a bicycle shop customer: a bicycle is a product, and a set of two matching wheels is a part (do not use the bicycle shop example in your project).
</p>

## Project Description 
<p>In this project, I have created a web-based application using Spring MVC for the business owner to track their Watch company's inventory. They can restock any parts needed to build more watches and easily modify their repository via forms. The application can validate data input and prevent errors from the owner handling the application. Junit tests have been implemented to ensure stability in the application. </p>

## Demo
